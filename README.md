## Installation setup

First of all you will need node installed to run the project, instruction on how to install node can be found here : 
https://nodejs.org/en/download/

Clone this repository in a new fresh folder, cd into the folder and run ```npm install```
This will read ```packages.json``` and install the required dependencies.

Then you should be ready to go.

To start in development mode:

```shell
npm start
```

Then go to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/). You should see your project running.

If port 3000 is not available, you can change this value by editing the file .reactserverrc and changing the value of ```port```, remember to restart the server afterwards.
